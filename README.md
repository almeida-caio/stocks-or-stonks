# ðŸ“ˆ Stocks or <i>stonks</i>: Can you tell a 1D random walk from real stock prices?
This is a very simple, but rather interesting, browser game. The core concept here is based on the [random walk hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk_hypothesis). So...

<p align = center> Are you able to distinguish the plots generated by a certain random process from the curves of real stocks? </p>

The game itself is programmed in Javascript, to be executed on a HTML file, but I had to design the plots separately. The 'image bank' of stock prices and one-dimensional random walks was created using Python; the code that generated all of the image files is available in this repo, if you want to check it out. In the case of real stocks, I retrieved some data from the [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) plataform.
